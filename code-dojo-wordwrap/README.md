    This kata is from Robert Martin and his blog includes a solution in Java
[\[1\]](http://thecleancoder.blogspot.com/2010/10/craftsman-62-dark-path.html)
.

Problem Description
-------------------

You write a class called Wrapper, that has a single static function
named wrap that takes two arguments, a string, and a column number. The
function returns the string, but with line breaks inserted at just the
right places to make sure that no line is longer than the column number.
You try to break lines at word boundaries.

Like a word processor, break the line by replacing the last space in a
line with a newline.

Comments from those who are working on this Kata
------------------------------------------------

Here you could write some thoughts about what you have learnt from this
Kata. If you want to discuss your approach and give some code samples,
you might want to link to a new page "KataXByY ". You don't have to post
all the code of your solution, or claim that it is the best possible
solution. What is interesting is your insights into the problem, and
decisions you made in the past.

### Different Algorithms

I (PeterKofler ) did the kata several times in Java and tried a
different variants each time. The different algorithms have increased
complexity in code but reduce the number of allocations. See
[\[6\]](http://blog.code-cop.org/2011/08/word-wrap-kata-variants.html)
for a detailed analysis of the variants together with code. It's nice to
see how the solution changes from recursive to tail recursive to a loop
which can be optimised even further.
